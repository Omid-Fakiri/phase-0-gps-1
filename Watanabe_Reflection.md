What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Before this GPS session I was not exactly clear on how branches worked, however Ryan was able to clearly explain it so me and so I believe I have a much better understanding about how they work.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
During this GPS session I was able learn a couple git commands that will be helpful such as git add .. Other than branches, I was fairly confident in my knowledge of git and Github and so this GPS helped boost my confidence as I was able to complete most releases without help from the guide.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Most of my questions were just reaffirming my actions. I did have some questions about some specific git commands, instead of looking them up I would ask my peers. This occured also with markdown file syntax, I didn't remember exactly how to add an inline image.

What still confuses you about Git?
I believe I have a firm understanding of Git. With practice I should become more adept and not have to look up the commands.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I had a great time pairing with OJ. He was a very kind person and we communicated very well. In the beginning I navigated and it we had an open dialogue about the exact steps he was taking for each release. When I became driver, I went a little faster than OJ did. He didn't speak out until after the GPS was over so I think I should be more concious about my speed, maybe in the future ask my partner if I am going too fast.
