# Reflecting on GPS 1.1

* **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
    `Before the GPS session, I was struggling with when to do the add and commit functions.  I initially tried to perform the add function before making changes to the file(s).  It took me a while to truly understand the purpose of the add function. With that said, this was something I figured out well before the GPS session. So, I didn't need to mention this during the session.`

* **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
    `I learned how to add files simultaneously by typing "git add .". If anything, Ryan pointed it out during the GPS. Neither Mike nor I even knew this was an option until Ryan mentioned it.`

* **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
    `The only question I remember asking was seeking confirmations from Ryan while I was navigating.  There were a few instances in which after giving an instruction to Mike, I asked Ryan to confirm if we performed those steps correctly.`

* **What still confuses you about Git?**
    `As of right now, I feel comfortable with Git. I just need to make sure that I retain any new information about Git when that time comes.`

* **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
    `It was a good experience overall. I felt nervous in the beginning. I wasn't on-point with the commands I needed to execute in the terminal in the beginning. But, I got better as time went on.`
    `I think Mike was very patient with me, and was a really good navigator. He was able to guide me step-by-step. At the same time, I think I could have done a better job navigating when he drove. I was ok at it, but not as solid as he was.`
    `I also think we both ended up putting ourselves in rabbit holes when we were driving. There were times in which we were not verbalizing our workflow. Everything worked out ok, but it is something both Mike and I can work on for future reference.`
